## Dynamic Programming - Coding Blocks Advance

- Optimal Substructure
- Overlapping Subproblem

- ðŸ’Ž - Important
- âœ” - Done
- ðŸŒŸ - Do once more

### 1-D DP
----------

- Fibonacci Number âœ”
  - Recursive, Time: O(2^n), Space: O(n) Stack Space
  - Top Down(Recursive + Memoization) : Time: O(n), Space: O(n) Stack Space, O(n) dp array space 
  - Bottom Up: Time: O(n), Space: O(n) dp array
  - Bottom Up Space optimzed:  Time: O(n), Space: O(1) as only last two past things are required to be remembered.
  - `TODO:` Via Matrix Exponentiation: Time: O(logn), Space: `TODO`
- Min Coin Change âœ”
- Min Steps to One âœ”
- Count Number of Binary strings with no 1s together(no two ones are consecutive) âœ”
- Friends Pairing âœ”
- Maximum Subarray Sum âœ”
  - Kadane's Algorithm 
- Ladder âœ”
  - #ways to reach nth step given we can jump upto k steps. Also 121 and 211 are seperate cases.

### 2-D DP
----------

- Wines Problem âœ”
- Catalan Number âœ”
- Ways to make change of money using coins array ðŸŒŸ âœ”
  - Min Coin Change âœ” is a different problem as: In this question we need to find the number of ways to make change, out of which which one is the minimum was the min coin change problem.
